Non-local boxes, a concept in quantum theory, are distributed objects that share
some correlations (classical or quantum). Consider a device with two ends, one
held by Alice, the other by Bob. Given input from both Alice and Bob, they will
both receive some output based on some probability distribution \(P(a,b|x,y\)
where \(x,y,a,b \in {0,1}\).

The model checker PRISM can be used to represent these boxes in its language,
to run simulations and experiments with. However, it is a low level language and
rudimentary in its nature.

The purpose of this project is to define a domain-specific language, Q'Grady, to
describe the set-up of these non-local boxes and to implement a compiler that
will take Q'Grady files and produce valid PRISM models that can be used for
further experimentation.
