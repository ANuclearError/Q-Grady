\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
Non-local boxes, a concept in quantum theory, are distributed objects that share
some correlations (classical or quantum). Consider a device with two ends, one
held by Alice, the other by Bob. Given input from both Alice and Bob, they will
both receive some output based on some probability distribution \(P(a,b|x,y\)
where \(x,y,a,b \in {0,1}\).

The model checker PRISM can be used to represent these boxes in its language,
to run simulations and experiments with. However, it is a low level language and
rudimentary in its nature.

The purpose of this project is to define a domain-specific language, Q'Grady, to
describe the set-up of these non-local boxes and to implement a compiler that
will take Q'Grady files and produce valid PRISM models that can be used for
further experimentation.

\subsection{Functional Requirements} % (fold)
\label{sub:functional_requirements}
The functional requirements of the Q'Grady language is to provide a cohesive
syntax and semantics to describe the set-up of non-local boxes.

The functional requirements of the Q'Grady compiler is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Take Q'Grady source files as input.
    \item Parse and check source for correctness in relation to syntax and
    semantics.
    \item Check probability distribution to ensure non-signalling property
    holds.
    \item Produce equivalent, correct, PRISM file that can be used in the PRISM
    software.
    \item Display the state of the compilation during execution to the user.
\end{itemize}
