I would like to thank my supervisor Ross Duncan for his teaching and guidance
throughout the project, without which I would not have been able to accomplish
this work.

I would also like to thank my lecturers throughout the University for their
teaching and support throughout all years of teaching.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support the past
year and my entire academic life. Their encouragement and inspiration proved
invaluable and will remain so in the future.
