Non-local boxes are theoretical objects where multiple parties share some
correlation, introduced by Sandu Popescu and Daniel Rohrlich as part of the
understanding of quantum non-locality. The model checker PRISM can be used to
simulate non-local boxes, but manually creating these models is not the best
approach.

The goal of this project was to define a language, named Q'Grady, for describing
the set-up of non-local boxes, distributed objects with some correlation, and a
compiler to convert the language into PRISM models for experiments.

The language would be able to allow for set-ups of arbitrary size and ranges of
values, with its syntax and semantics. The compiler would take Q'Grady files and
analyse the set-up to determine its validity before converting the set-up into a
working PRISM model.

Once completed, experimentation using PRISM was to be undertaken afterwards.

\label{sec:project_outcomes}
The Q'Grady language and compiler are capable of handling different set-ups of
non-local boxes, whether they have 2 or 4 inputs or whether each input is a
binary or ternary digit. The compiler is also to identify set-ups that cannot be
correctly modelled, with mostly meaningful error messages to assist the user.

The development of the system took much longer than originally anticipated, with
a lot of time being spent on trying to make the system work on this arbitrary
set-ups. This meant that there was not enough time to perform any interesting
experiments using PRISM. In addition, the focus on the development saw the
more formalised semantics be neglected in favour of the compiler.
