\section{Verification} % (fold)
\label{sec:verification}
In relation to the verification of the language and compiler, there are the
following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the compiler recognize invalid set-ups?
    \item Are the generated models correct?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recognizing Invalid Set-up} % (fold)
\label{sub:recognizing_invalid_set_up}
The recognizing of invalid set-ups is done with the \texttt{SemanticAnalyser}
class, so the testing of that class was of vital importance in ensuring that
the system is able to distinguish correct set-ups from incorrect set-ups. In
particular, the non-signalling property needs tested to ensure that is able to
handle the possible outcomes. Using JUnit, a \texttt{SemanticAnalyerTest} class
was created to handle the test cases that would occur.

\subsection{Validating Models} % (fold)
\label{sub:validating_models}
In the PRISM software, there is a feature `Compute Steady State Probabilities'
that can be used to determine whether the generated models match the Q'Grady
file. By dividing each probability in the distribution by the total number of
rows that create the distribution, we can compare it to the steady state
probabilities to determine whether or not the distribution of the input Q'Grady
file has been converted into the equivalent PRISM model.

Naturally, an inaccurate FileGeneration class would also present the
possibility of generating models PRISM could not compile,

\section{Validation} % (fold)
\label{sec:validation}
The original requirements of this project was to create a language for defining
the set-ups of non-local boxes, and the development of a compiler to translate
these set-ups into PRISM models. The language and compiler must ensure that
non-signalling is not violated. The final conclusions of this report will
outline that while the Q'Grady language and compiler can handle boxes with two
outputs of any range, more work would be required to ensure that the compiler
can handle set-ups with three or more outputs.

Another requirement was the production of meaningful error messages to the user.
While the semantics analysis of the input file does produce meaningful error
messages, the syntax checking of the file does not have the same level of
handling.

In relation to non-functional requirements, the User Guide of Appendix
\ref{cha:user_guide} achieves this goal, in providing someone the ability to
create their own boxes without extensive PRISM knowledge. The speed of the
compiler is certainly within reason.
