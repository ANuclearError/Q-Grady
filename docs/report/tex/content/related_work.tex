\section{Non-Local Boxes} % (fold)
\label{sec:non_local_boxes}
Consider a device with two ends, one of which is held by Alice, and the other of
which is held by Bob. Each end has an input that can be provided by Alice (which
we will call \(x\)) or Bob (which we will call \(y\), and an output that each
can observe (\(a\) and \(b\) respectively. This would be our box, and it will
output \(a\) and \(b\) based on some probability distribution \(P(a, b | x, y)\)
where \(a, b, x, y \in {0, 1}\).

An example of such a box would be the Popescu/Rohrlich (PR) box, the probability
distribution of which is provided below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | c c c c}
  & 00 & 01 & 10 & 11 \\
  \hline
  00 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & 0 & 0 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) \\
  01 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & 0 & 0 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) \\
  10 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & 0 & 0 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) \\
  11 & 0 & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Where the row specifies the input \(x\) and \(y\), and the output specifies the
output \(a\) and \(b\).

\subsection{Non-Signalling} % (fold)
\label{sub:non_signalling}
As essential part of the definition of a non-local box is the non-signalling
property. A non-signalling box means that Alice could not use the value of \(a\)
to determine the value of \(y\) in the above configuration. This condition
allows for the probability distribution \(P(a, b | x, y)\) to be reduced to
simply \(P(a|x\).

To ensure non-signalling, the following conditions must be met:

\[\sum_{b} P(a, b | x, y) = \sum_{b} P(a, b | x, y') = P(a | x) 
\quad \forall a, x, y, y'\]
\[\sum_{a} P(a, b | x, y) = \sum_{a} P(a, b | x', y) = P(b | y) 
\quad \forall b, y, x, x'\]

The PR-box is one such example of a non-signalling box.
