# Q'Grady

Q'Grady is a language that assists in creating non-local boxes in PRiSM. It is
the basis of the author's dissertation for the degree M. Eng in Computer
Science, 2015-16 at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow.

The Q'Grady language defines the structure for non-local boxes, and its compiler
will compile the Q'Grady files into PRiSM models.
