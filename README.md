# Q'Grady

Q'Grady (A Compiler for PRiSM) is a language that assists in creating non-local
boxes in PRiSM. It is the basis of the author's dissertation for the degree M.
Eng in Computer Science, 2015-16 at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow.

The Q'Grady language defines the structure for non-local boxes, and its compiler
will compile the Q'Grady files into PRiSM models.
